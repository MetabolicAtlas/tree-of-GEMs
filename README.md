These codes have three purposes. Firstly, to download xml of publications related to models (GEMs) along with their meta data. Secondly, to search for correlations between models and their respective publications. Lastly, to enable a smooth and organized method of displaying the information gathered/acertained from the previous code.

To each purpose, there is a different code. The currently uploaded code are shown below.
